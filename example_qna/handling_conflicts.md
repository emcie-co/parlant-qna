# How do you handle conflicts between different business requirements?

When different departments have competing requirements, the solution isn't to try to satisfy everyone in each interaction. Instead, use Parlant's context evaluation to determine which requirements take precedence in specific situations.

For example, your sales team might want the agent to be proactive about upgrade opportunities, while your support team prioritizes resolving current issues first. Instead of trying to combine these approaches, you can refine your guidelines to specify when each behavior is appropriate: "Only discuss upgrades after the current support issue is resolved" or "Prioritize immediate problem resolution for customers marked as frustrated."

The key is to make these priority decisions explicit in your guidelines rather than hoping the agent will figure out the right balance. Parlant's engine will then consistently apply these priorities across all interactions.
